# **TASK 1 : 3D PRINTING**
### OBJECTIVE:
Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an STL file, and then learn to slice it (using ultimaker or creality slicer).Go through the SOP'S regarding the 3d printer. Learn about bed temperature, infill density and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and slice it and put it for print.

### OUTCOMES & LEARNING :
**PLA (Polylactic Acid):** A popular, biodegradable 3D printing filament made from renewable resources. It is easy to print, has low warping, and emits minimal odor, making it ideal for beginners.

**Bed Temperature:** For PLA, a heated bed is optional but typically set between 50–60°C to help with the first-layer adhesion and reduce warping.

**Printing Speed:** Generally set between 40–60 mm/s for standard PLA prints. Slower speeds improve print quality, especially for detailed or small models.

**Pre-Procedure (Before Printing):**

- Download or create a 3D model and save/export it as an STL file.

- Open the model in slicer software (e.g., Creality Slicer or Cura), select the appropriate printer model, and import the STL file.

- Adjust essential print settings: layer height, print speed, bed temperature, nozzle temperature (around 190–220°C for PLA), infill density (affects strength and material usage), support structures, and bed adhesion methods.

- Slice the model to generate G-code — the set of instructions the printer will follow.

- Transfer the G-code file to the 3D printer (usually via SD card or USB cable).
  

**Post-Procedure (After Printing)**

- Allow the print bed to cool down before removing the model to prevent warping or damage.

- Carefully remove the finished model from the print bed, using a spatula if necessary.

- Remove any support structures or rafts included in the print. Use pliers or cutters as needed.



**Additional Essential Printer Settings:**

- **Infill Density:** Determines how solid the print will be inside. Standard values: 10–20% for most models, but higher for stronger parts.

- **Layer Height:** Lower values (e.g., 0.1mm) yield finer details, while higher values (e.g., 0.2–0.3mm) print faster but with rougher surfaces.

- **Bed Leveling:** Ensure the print bed is level before beginning to ensure proper adhesion and print quality.

  
  **These are the steps to  be follwed to get a perfect 3D model.**

It uses a two-stage system:
Stage 1: A solid-propellant booster provides initial acceleration. 
Stage 2: A liquid-fueled ramjet engine sustains the high-speed flight.

- ### Stealth Design:
The missile has a small radar cross-section (RCS) due to stealth materials and design, reducing its detectability. 

- ### Guidance System:
It employs an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for mid-course correction and an active radar seeker for final terminal homing, achieving high accuracy.

# **TASK 9 : TINKERCAD**
### OBJECTIVE:
Create a Tinkercad account and familiarize yourself with the application. Simulate a simple circuit using an ultrasonic sensor to estimate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor, and display the results on the serial monitor. Create a radar system using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to detect objects within a certain range.

 ### OUTCOMES & LEARNING :
 #### INTRO ABOUT TINKERCAD :

 ### What I learnt from TINKERCAD Task :
 - I learnt how to build a circuit in tinkercad.
 - And also I learnt how to simulate the circuit.

 ## CIRCUIT CONNECTOINS  :
 ![image alt](https://github.com/sujan935/Tinkercad_Sujana/blob/main/ultrasonic,.png?raw=true)
  
 ### **Working principle of ultrasonic sensor :**
 The sensor first emits a short burst of ultrasonic waves using a transmitter (often a piezoelectric crystal).

These waves travel through the air until they encounter an object, at which point they are reflected back toward the sensor.

A receiver (sometimes the same transducer as the transmitter) detects the reflected echo.

The sensor then calculates the time taken for the emitted wave to return after hitting an object, known as the "time-of-flight".

Using the known speed of sound in air, the distance to the object is calculated with the formula:

Distance=(Time
×
Speed of Sound)/2
 
The division by 2 accounts for the round-trip (outgoing and incoming) journey of the sound wave .

![image alt](https://github.com/sujan935/Tinkercad_Sujana/blob/main/ultra%20sonic.webp?raw=true)

 ### **Working principle of servo motor :**
-  The servo receives a command signal, usually in the form of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), indicating the desired position for the output shaft.

- The internal control circuit compares this command signal with feedback from a position sensor, often a potentiometer or encoder attached to the shaft.

- If there is a difference (error) between the actual and desired shaft positions, the control circuit generates an error signal that drives the motor to correct the shaft’s movement.

- As the motor rotates, the feedback sensor continually updates the control circuit with the new position, maintaining accuracy until the desired position is reached and the error is zero.

# **TASK 10: SPEED CONTROL OF DC MOTOR**
### OBJECTIVE :
Explore basic techniques for controlling DC motors, understand the control DC motors using the L298N motor driver and the Arduino board. Using an UNO and H-Bridge L298N motor driver, control the speed of a 5V BO motor, try simulating this on tinkercad and then perform it on the hardware, Record videos of you doing the same.

### Outcomes and Learnings
- I learnt how to control the speed of the DC motor. 
- I learnt working principle of L298N motor driver.
- I learnt concept of H-Bridge and PWM(Pulse Width Modulator)
  
### **Theory Behind L298N Motor Driver**

Understanding Motor Control Basics
before learning about the L298N motor driver, it’s important to understand two key concepts:

- H-Bridge circuit – allows us to control the direction of the motor’s rotation.
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) – helps control the speed of a DC motor.
### Controlling Direction with an H-Bridge :
DC motors are the easiest motors to use! If you connect a battery to a DC motor, it will spin in one direction. If you swap the wires, it spins in the other direction. But you can’t always physically swap the wires every time you want to change direction. That’s where an H-bridge comes in handy!
An H-bridge is a special circuit with four electronic switches arranged in an “H” shape, with the motor in the middle.

By turning these switches on and off in a specific order, you can make electricity flow through the motor in one direction or the opposite direction. This clever trick lets you control which way the motor spins without having to physically reverse any wires.


The animation below shows how an H-bridge works :

![image alt](https://github.com/sujan935/speed_sujana/blob/main/H-Bridge-Working-Motor-Direction-Control-Animation.gif?raw=true) 

### Controlling Speed with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
When a fixed voltage is given to a DC motor, it spins at a fixed speed. If you want to change the speed, you need to adjust the voltage. A higher voltage makes the motor spin faster, while a lower voltage makes it slower.

However, physically changing the voltage all the time isn’t very practical. That’s where PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation, comes in.

PWM is a smart way to control the average amount of power sent to the motor. Instead of sending a fixed voltage, PWM rapidly turns the voltage ON and OFF in very quick pulses.
The “width” of each ON pulse, also called the duty cycle, determines how long the voltage is “ON” during each cycle.

If the voltage is ON for most of the time (a wider pulse), the motor receives a higher average voltage and spins faster.
If the voltage is OFF for most of the time (a narrower pulse), the motor receives a lower average voltage and spins slower.
The image below shows how different duty cycles affect motor speed.

 # **TASK 11 : LED TOGGLE USING ESP32**
### OBJECTIVE :
Learn how to use an ESP32 to create a standalone web server that controls an LED connected to the ESP32 GPIOs. Use the Arduino IDE to code and upload the program to the ESP32.
### OUTCOMES & LEARNING :
Toggling an LED using an ESP32 means turning it on and off repeatedly by controlling a digital GPIO pin. In the code, the GPIO pin connected to the LED is set as an output, and its state is changed between HIGH and LOW. This switching creates a blinking effect, and is commonly done using a delay between each toggle in the loop.

 - I learnt the working principle of ESP32.
 - I learnt the circuit connection of breadboard.

# **TASK 1 : 3D PRINTING**
### OBJECTIVE:
Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an STL file, and then learn to slice it (using ultimaker or creality slicer).Go through the SOP'S regarding the 3d printer. Learn about bed temperature, infill density and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and slice it and put it for print.

### OUTCOMES & LEARNING :
**PLA (Polylactic Acid):** A popular, biodegradable 3D printing filament made from renewable resources. It is easy to print, has low warping, and emits minimal odor, making it ideal for beginners.

**Bed Temperature:** For PLA, a heated bed is optional but typically set between 50–60°C to help with the first-layer adhesion and reduce warping.

**Printing Speed:** Generally set between 40–60 mm/s for standard PLA prints. Slower speeds improve print quality, especially for detailed or small models.

**Pre-Procedure (Before Printing):**

- Download or create a 3D model and save/export it as an STL file.

- Open the model in slicer software (e.g., Creality Slicer or Cura), select the appropriate printer model, and import the STL file.

- Adjust essential print settings: layer height, print speed, bed temperature, nozzle temperature (around 190–220°C for PLA), infill density (affects strength and material usage), support structures, and bed adhesion methods.

- Slice the model to generate G-code — the set of instructions the printer will follow.

- Transfer the G-code file to the 3D printer (usually via SD card or USB cable).
  

**Post-Procedure (After Printing)**

- Allow the print bed to cool down before removing the model to prevent warping or damage.

- Carefully remove the finished model from the print bed, using a spatula if necessary.

- Remove any support structures or rafts included in the print. Use pliers or cutters as needed.



**Additional Essential Printer Settings:**

- **Infill Density:** Determines how solid the print will be inside. Standard values: 10–20% for most models, but higher for stronger parts.

- **Layer Height:** Lower values (e.g., 0.1mm) yield finer details, while higher values (e.g., 0.2–0.3mm) print faster but with rougher surfaces.

- **Bed Leveling:** Ensure the print bed is level before beginning to ensure proper adhesion and print quality.

  
  **These are the steps to  be follwed to get a perfect 3D model.**
  # **TASK 2 : API**
### OBJECTIVE :
Learn about what is API and using any API of your choice, build a user interface (web app, mobile app, etc.) to make calls and display information.

### OUTCOMES & LEARNING :
API stands for Application Programming Interface(API), which helps the user to interact with the server.
It accepts the requests from the user and sends it to the server. After processing the data from the server is sent as output to the user using the same API medium.

### What I learnt from API Task :
- I lernt a bit about  HTML & CSS.
- I lernt how to run a code in visual studio code by using live server.
